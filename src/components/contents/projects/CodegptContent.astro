    <Paragraph>Even though a series of codes can achieve the same functions, their differences in composition and algorithm make them different in execution efficiency.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>Recently, OpenAI has released an AI-powered language model called <b>ChatGPT</b>, which can understand human language and answer questions. With its suggestions, we aim to optimize code performance more efficiently.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>In our project, we developed a website based on <b>open-source APIs</b> to display and revise code from Internet. <b>LSP (Language Server Protocol)</b> integrated in our code editor will implement support for finding all references and locating function body on focus, and thus to identify specific functions that require to be optimized.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>After accomplishing the development stage, we applied it to open-source code to evaluate and improve the web page experience and to optimize the performance of the programming code.</Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      Although the duration of this project was short (about 2 months), it was actually the first real research project related to human-computer interaction (HCI) that I embarked on. It was through this project that the door to the HCI research field was opened for me.

    <Paragraph>
      In previous projects, even though I gradually considered user needs during the development process, the focus was still more on fulfilling functional requirements or getting algorithms to work. This was the first time I developed with the premise of considering what users might need.

    <Paragraph>
      Inspired by the professor Dr. Liu, who directly advised us for this project, I also began to think more about how to inject innovative ideas into the project, rather than simply focusing on engineering tasks.
